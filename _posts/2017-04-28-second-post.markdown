There are many English words that you cannot find exact equivalences in Chinese. Among which my favorite is the word "deadline". It is usually translated to Chinese as "截止日期", which simply means "due date". 

No wonder that I like the English word better: with the "deadly" part of the word, I can almost feel my miserable destiny vividly if I fail to meet it. After all "deadline" originally means "a line drawn within or around a prison that a prisoner passes at the risk of being shot" according to Merriam-Webster's Colleglate Dictionary. 

However a wonderful word it is, I have to say that I hate it when I have plural of them! Six lab reports ddl's, one major project ddl, one group project ddl, individual and group reports and big presentations ddl's... I wanna say: I am really dying even though I am still "so behind bars" and not passing any lines. 

This Sunday is a big festival in Uppsala, the city I am living in. I am going to bike around and take some good pictures ... AND, of course, start soon and make sure I have reports in hand when I pass the ddl's!

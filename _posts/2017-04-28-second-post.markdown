There are many English words that you can not find an exact equivalence in Chinese. Among which my favorite is the word "deadline". It is usually translated to Chinese as "截止日期", which simply means "due date". 

No wonder that I like the English word better: with the "deadly" part of the word, I can almost feel my miserable destiny vividly if it is not meeted. After all deadline originally means "a line drawn within or around a prison that a prisoner passes at the risk of being shot" according to Merriam-Webster's Colleglate Dictionary.

However, a wonderful word it is, I hate it when I have many of them! Six lab reports, one major project, one group project, individual and group reports and big presentations... I wanna say: give a break...which is also one of my favorite English expressions. 

This Sunday is a big festival in Uppsala, the city I am living in. I am going to bike around and take some good pictures ... AND, of course, start soon and meet my next ddl on time!

JULY flew away without me even noticing. I finished five week courses on machine learning, went to Denmark and visited some traditional Swedish houses. I would say that this is the best summer I have ever had. 


The idea of doing researches based on Chinese historical text comes to me again and again. Nonethless I lack necessary practical ways to make it happen. It can count as an idea now. 


Need to prepare myself for school in August.  


Sommaren Ã¤r kort.

# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

#Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
#line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
#Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
